						Project - 4

Pre-Requisites :
1) Jenkins Server
2) Setup Ansible Server with ansible as user and install docker with dockeradmin as user
3) Setup Ansible client with ansible as user and install docker with dockeradmin as user
4) Docker Hub account
5) ansible and dockeradmin users must be in same group docker for both Ansible & Dockerhost

Run on both servers:
gpasswd -a ansible docker
gpasswd -a dockeradmin docker

Part-01 : Create an docker image from Dockerfile which is placed on GitHub

Login to Jenkins console

Create Jenkins job as Project-4

Fill the following details :

Source Code Management:
Repository : https://github.com/YogeshSanjayChaudhary/hello-world.git
Branches to build : */master

Build:
Root POM:pom.xml
Goals and options : clean install package

Post Steps > Add post-build steps

Send files or execute commands over SSH

Name: ansible_server
Source files : webapp/target/*.war
Remove prefix : webapp/target
Remote directory : //opt//docker

Post Steps > Add post-build steps

Send files or execute commands over SSH

Name: ansible_server
Source files : Dockerfile
Remote directory : //opt//docker
Exec Command:
cd /opt/docker
docker build -t myproject .
docker tag myproject yogeshchaudhary/myproject
docker push yogeshchaudhary/myproject
docker rmi myproject yogeshchaudhary/myproject

*** Login to docker hub from ansible user before build is executed.

login to docker hub and check. shouldn't find images with for myproject

Execute Jenkins job

check images in Docker hub. Now you could able to see new images pushed to yogeshchaudhary Docker_Hub

Troubleshooting:

Docker should be installed on ansible server
Should login to "docker hub" on ansible server
ansadmin user should be part of docker group

---------------------------

Part-02 : Deploy Containers
Write a yml file to create a container (file name : docker_container.yml)

  ---
  - hosts: demo
    become: true
    tasks:
     - name: stop the container
       shell: docker stop myproject

     - name: remove stopped container
       shell: docker rm -f myproject

     - name: remove docker images
       shell: docker image rm -f yogeshchaudhary/myproject
  
Use this script for 1-st     
     - name: create docker image
       shell: docker run -d --name myproject -p 8090:8080 yogeshchaudhary/myproject


Add this script to Jenkins job.

Choose "configure" to modify your jenkins job.
Under post build actions
Send files or execute commands over SSH
Exec Command:

   cd /opt/playbooks
   ansible-playbook docker_container.yml
Execute Jenkins job.

You could see a new container on your docker host. can able access it from browser on port 8090

Troubleshooting: Makesure you have opened required ports on AWS Security group for this server.
